When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.

'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
