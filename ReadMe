Deployment:
 
1.Launch new ubuntu instance using Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-5189a661  , 
2.ssh into instance run HAPYAKDEMOMAKERINSTALL/HAPYAKINSTALL this will install the demomaker and the dependencies, it should take a while
3. git needs to be setup to login automatically and the json key must be added manually
so to set up git to run automatically add a file named .netrc in /home/ubuntu with the login info 
for example

machine github.com
       login 
       password 

4. The google developer key needs to be added at /home/ubuntu/developerkey.json the developer 
	key location must be updated in HAPYAKFUNCTIONS.py
5. start Process with:
	sudo service hapyak start

 
Known Bugs
-linebreaks and other commas are not screw up the parsing of the spreadsheet 
-the git repository inflates over time with garbage, eventually using up all the storage space in the system
-In Case of failure to update, if the hapyak demomaker service fails to update, ssh into the instance and send command=sudo service hapyak start
	demomaker.log writes and stores alot for easier debugging, currently this adds up to a meg or 2 per day, so hapyak service should be restarted maybe once a year 
-a bug with Amazon seems to be that reboots can occasionally make an instance unreachable, the easy solution is to stop the instance make an image of it 
	instance and launch another instance
